		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
			The projector is a light-source that emits light from a single point in one
			direction, along a rectangular cone that increases in size the further from the light it gets.
			The color of the light is read from a texture to produce a projector-like effect.<br /><br />

			This light can cast shadows - see the [page:ProjectorShadow] page for details.
		</div>




		<h2>Example</h2>

		<h2>Code Example</h2>
		<code>
		// projector shining from the side, casting a shadow
		var projector = new THREE.Projector( 0xffffff );

		projector.position.set( 100, 1000, 100 );
		projector.map = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(textureUrl);
		projector.fov = 30;
		projector.aspect = 16 / 9;

		projector.castShadow = true;

		projector.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
		projector.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;

		projector.shadow.camera.near = 500;
		projector.shadow.camera.far = 4000;

		scene.add( projector );
		</code>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [page:Integer color], [page:Float intensity], [page:Float distance], [page:Float fov], [page:Float aspect], [page:Float decay] )</h3>
		<div>
			[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br />
			[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br /><br />
			[page:Float distance] - Maximum distance from origin where light will shine whose intensity
			is attenuated linearly based on distance from origin. <br />
			[page:Float fov] - The vertical field-of-view for the projector in degrees.<br />
			[page:Float aspect] - The aspect-ratio (width / height) of the beam. Default is 1.<br />
			[page:Float decay] - The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.<br /><br />

			Creates a new [name].
		</div>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.


		<h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
		<div>
			The position of the light-source in it's reference coordinate-system.
			This is set equal to [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] (0, 1, 0), so that the light shines from the top down.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
		<div>
			The Projector points from its [page:.position position] to target.position. The default
			position of the target is *(0, 0, 0)*.<br />

			*Note*: For the target's position to be changed to anything other than the default,
			it must be added to the [page:Scene scene] using
			<code>
				scene.add( light.target );
			</code>

			This is so that the target's [page:Object3D.matrixWorld matrixWorld] gets automatically
			updated each frame.<br /><br />

			It is also possible to set the target to be another object in the scene (anything with a
			[page:Object3D.position position] property), like so:
			<code>
				var targetObject = new THREE.Object3D();
				scene.add(targetObject);

				projector.target = targetObject;
			</code>
			The projector will now track the target object.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isProjector]</h3>
		<div>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are projectors. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Texture map]</h3>
		<div>
			A [page:Texture] used to calculate the color of the light at a given fragment-position.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float fov]</h3>
		<div>
			The vertical field-of-view angle of the projector specified in degrees. Should be smaller than 180.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float aspect]</h3>
		<div>
			Aspect ratio (width / height) of the projector-beam. Default is 1.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
		<div>
			If non-zero, light will attenuate linearly from maximum intensity at the light's
			position down to zero at this distance from the light. Default is *0.0*.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
		<div>
			The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, decay = 2 leads to
			physically realistic light falloff. The default is *1*.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float power]</h3>
		<div>
			The light's power.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, the luminous
			power of the light measured in lumens. Default is *4Math.PI*. <br /><br />

			This is directly related to the [page:.intensity intensity] in the ratio
			<code>
				power = intensity * &pi;
			</code>
			and changing this will also change the intensity.
		</div>


		<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
		<div>
			If set to *true* light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and
			requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [page:ProjectorShadow] for details.
			The default is *false*.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:ProjectorShadow shadow]</h3>
		<div>
			A [page:ProjectorShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.
		</div>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		See the base [page:Light Light] class for common methods.

		<h3>[method:Projector copy]( [page:SpotLight source] )</h3>
		<div>
		Copies value of all the properties from the [page:Projector source] to this
		Projector.
		</div>
